## Positive Interactions
When it comes to interactions with people, but especially young children, phrasing things in a positive rather than negative manner can have a huge impact on the outcome. This is starting off as a list of negative to positive conversions to help make those interactions better.

Showing empathy towards the person also allows a greater connection to grow between you both, further encouraging the relationship to improve.
